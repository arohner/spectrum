# spectrum

A library for doing static analysis of Clojure code, catching clojure.spec conform errors at compile time.

**Wait what?**

It's like core.typed, but it relies on clojure.spec annotations.

**So it's an optional static type system?**

Kind-of. It finds errors at compile time, and predicates kind of look like types. So sure.

## Current Status

Developer Preview, not yet ready for any kind of use.

Current development is working towards making spectrum self-check.

## Goals

- usable
- pragmatic
- readable implementation
- fast
- configurable strictness levels
- incremental checking

## Non-goals

- perfection
- correctness
- requiring 100% spec coverage.

In particular, spectrum aims to be fast and usable, and catching
bugs. It aims to have low false positives, at the expense of
potentially not catching 100% of type errors.

A tool that catches 80% of bugs that you use every day is better
than a 100% tool that you don't use. Spectrum will converge on 100% correct,
but won't guarantee correctness for a while.

## Usage

Still under active development, so this is incomplete.

Use clojure.spec as normal. Then, at the repl:

```clojure
(require '[spectrum.flow :as f])
(require '[spectrum.types :as t])

(f/infer-var #'foo)
```


There is also

```clojure
(f/infer-form '(foo 3))
```
which is useful when you want to debug the signature of a form.

`infer-form` can optionally take a map of keywordized variables to types

```clojure
(f/infer-form '(string? x) {:x #'string?})
#Value[true]

(f/infer-form '(string? x) {:x (t/value-t 3)})
#Value[false]
```

## Limitations

- It's still very early.

## Justification

- because I could
- working example of types = proofs = predicates
- Some properties of a program are easier to prove at runtime. Some at compile-time
- this is extra checking on top of spec, not a replacement for it
- to get HN to shut up about how adding a static type system to a dynamic language is impossible
- why not just use spec by itself?
 - `instrument` doesn't check return values
 - `check` works best on pure functions with good generators.
  - Not all clojure code is pure
  - Not always easy to write a good generator for all functions (hello, any fn that takes a DB connection)
  - Not always easy to write a generator w/ 100% coverage
 - you can't spec non-defn functions
 - you can't spec higher order functions
 - generative testing with side-effects doesn't work well
 - generative testing gives false negatives on rare codepaths
 - static typing guarantees all codepaths are checked
 - spec doesn't deal with non-fn vars at all (binding, alter-var-root, set!, etc)
 - generative testing can be slow

## Plan

Spectrum is still very early, and not ready for production use. Current development is focused on making spectrum self-check.
